# CyberArkDashboard

This script polls each of the 4 PVWA's, CPM and PSM to check the CyberArk services statuses and backup scheduled tasks and
then compiles the information into a .HTML file. Once the .HTML file is generated, this script will copy the index.html file 
to each of the 4 PVWA's C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Health directories

Fully customizable to suit the number of component servers in your CyberArk ecosystem.
